        Samsung released its newest phone, the Galaxy Note 8, on Wednesday with both the usual fanfare and a dose of humility,
        thanking customers for sticking with its flagship line after the company's last version had to be recalled.
          </p>
          <p class="four">
        None of us will ever forget what happened last year. I know I won't," said company president DJ Koh at a Samsung
        event in New York to present the Note 8.

        The South Korean technology giant has a lot riding on the device beyond winning over consumers.
        The successor to the Note 7, which had to be recalled twice for a tendency to burst into flames, the Note 8 is Samsung's biggest, priciest and most powerful phone. It comes at a time Samsung is set to invest deeply into new manufacturing facilities.

<p class="five">
Customers who had bought the Note 7 will get an instant trade-in value worth up to $425 through a special offer on Samsung.com, the company said. It'll be a tall order for Samsung, considering that starting last September up to 3 million Note 7 phones were recalled after a number of units overheated and some caught fire.
